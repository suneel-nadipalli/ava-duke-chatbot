able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll in. You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your

For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters. 13. When do classes start? Fall 2021 classes begin on August 23, 2021. 14. What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 15. How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses? AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class. 16. How will classes be offered in Fall 2021 (e.g., all in-person, online, or a mix of the two)? While Duke will offer classes fully in-person for the Fall 2021 semester, we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students. AIPI classes will be offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person","The process for AIPI students to enroll in graduate courses outside of the AIPI program involves obtaining approval from both the course instructor and the AIPI Director. Students must seek permission from the instructor of the desired course, as it is ultimately at the instructor's discretion to determine whether AIPI students will be allowed into the particular class. Additionally, the AIPI Director must also provide approval for enrollment in courses outside of the AIPI curriculum.

It is important to note that graduate courses outside of AIPI require an instructor's permission to enroll, and students must adhere to the guidelines and procedures set forth by both the course instructor and the AIPI Director in order to successfully enroll in courses outside of the AIPI program."
How many audited courses are AIPI students allowed to take per semester?,"to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a
22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students? Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs. For more information on the most common financial aid resources that our students utilize, please

Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12.

What do I do if I want to change my elective track? If you wish to change your elective track, there is no formal action that you need to take. However, it is a good idea to speak with the program director about your elective course plans, as they can help steer you toward courses that align with your professional aspirations. 21. How can I track my degree progress? Students can track their degree progress using Stellic, a self-service tool that enables students to see which classes they have taken toward their degree and plan for future semesters. Students are strongly encouraged to use Stellic throughout the course of the AIPI Program so that they can stay on track to graduate within the timeframe they choose (two or three semesters).

1. GPA: When a student audits a course, they will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward their GPA. Audited courses do not affect the student's GPA in any way.

2. Degree Requirements: Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of degree requirements in the AIPI program. While auditing a course allows students to gain knowledge and experience without the pressure of grades affecting their GPA, these courses will not count towards the total credits required for completing the AIPI program.

It's important for students to keep these factors in mind when deciding whether to audit a course, as it may impact their progress towards completing the program within the expected timeframe."

For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters. 13. When do classes start? Fall 2021 classes begin on August 23, 2021. 14. What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 15. How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses? AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class. 16. How will classes be offered in Fall 2021 (e.g., all in-person, online, or a mix of the two)? While Duke will offer classes fully in-person for the Fall 2021 semester, we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students. AIPI classes will be offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person

Do I still have to pay fees? If you will not be on campus in the Fall 2021 semester due to COVID-19, please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, regarding student fees. Working While a Student 27. How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position? Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before. In order to be on Duke’s payroll, all students must have a Social Security Number",Most students at the AIPI Campus typically enroll in 12.0 credits per semester as a full-time load.

Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).

Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11.

What classes outside of the AIPI curriculum can I count toward my technical electives requirement? Approved AIPI electives are listed on the AIPI website. Additionally, students may take technical electives in other programs and departments across campus with approval from both the course instructor and the AIPI Director. Please note that graduate courses outside of AIPI require an instructor’s permission to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses
able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll in. You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your","The required courses differ between residential graduate students and online students at the AIPI Campus as follows:

1. Residential Graduate Students:
   - In the Fall semester, residential graduate students at the AIPI Campus are required to take a fixed set of 4 courses: AIPI 510, AIPI 520, AIPI 530, and MENG 570.
   - The full-time residential students typically have a full-time load of 12.0 credits per semester (equivalent to four 3.0-credit courses).

2. Online Students:
   - Online students at the AIPI Campus typically take 2 courses per semester in the Fall: AIPI 510 and AIPI 520.
   - Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis.

In summary, while residential graduate students take a fixed set of 4 courses in the Fall semester, online students at the AIPI Campus typically take 2 courses per semester. Additionally, the tuition payment structure differs between residential and online students."
"How are tuition fees structured for online students at AIPI Campus, compared to residential graduate students?","22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change.

How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a

For International Students 33. I am an international student hoping to come to the United States for Fall 2021, but my home country is backlogged with visa applications due to COVID-19. What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll","For AIPI students who are full-time residential students and pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis, there is an option to take a fifth credit for free each semester. In order to take advantage of this option, students do not need to take any formal actions. The ability to enroll in a fifth credit for free is automatically available to eligible students. However, it is generally recommended that students consult with their program director or advisor before enrolling in a fifth credit to ensure that the workload is manageable given the intensity of the courses."
What are the key differences between the 12-month and 16-month plans for Campus students in the AIPI Program?,"last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12. For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters. 13. When do classes start? Fall 2021 classes begin on August 23, 2021. 14. What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 15. How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses? AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class. 16. How will classes be offered in Fall 2021 (e.g., all in-person, online, or a mix of the two)? While Duke will offer classes fully in-person for the Fall 2021 semester, we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students. AIPI classes will be offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person

I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your

Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11.

University policies surrounding academics may also be found on the Office of the University Registrar website. 19. Is there a formal process for designating my elective track? No, there is not currently a formal process to designate your elective track. We do not require students to rigidly adhere to one elective track. Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward","For Campus students in the Duke AIPI Program, there are key differences between the 12-month and 16-month plans:

1. **Duration:** 
   - The 12-month plan is a more accelerated option where students complete the program in one year.
   - The 16-month plan allows students to spread out their coursework and complete the program in a year and four months.

2. **Course Load:**
   - In the 12-month plan, students typically take a heavier course load each semester to complete the program in a shorter time frame.
   - The 16-month plan may offer a slightly lighter course load per semester, allowing for more time to focus on each course.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - The 12-month plan may have a more structured schedule with fewer breaks between semesters.
   - The 16-month plan provides students with a bit more flexibility in terms of course selection and time management.

4. **Impact on Course Selection:**
   - Choosing between the 12-month and 16-month plans may affect the selection of courses in the Fall and Spring semesters, so making this decision early is recommended.

5. **Transition to In-Person Classes:**
   - For students anticipating arriving in Durham after the drop/add period but before September 22, enrolling in the hybrid sections of courses is advisable to allow for a smooth transition from online to in-person classes.

Overall, the key differences between the 12-month and 16-month plans for Campus students in the AIPI Program lie in the duration, course load, flexibility, impact on course selection, and the transition to in-person classes based on individual circumstances and preferences."

I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your
last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students?

Working While a Student 27. How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position? Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before. In order to be on Duke’s payroll, all students must have a Social Security Number","For AIPI courses in the Campus program, students should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class each week. This means that for a typical full-time load of 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses), students should allocate around 32-40 hours per week for coursework outside of class. It is important to note that AIPI classes are challenging and require significant dedication and effort outside of the classroom to succeed in the program."

What can I do this summer to prepare for AIPI? While some of our students","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted travel and visa issues for international students at the Duke AIPI Program. Due to travel restrictions and visa challenges caused by the pandemic, many international students have faced difficulties in arriving in the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. In response to these challenges, AIPI classes for the Fall 2021 semester will be offered both in-person and online to accommodate students who may be unable to travel to Durham, NC, USA. 

For students who are physically located in Durham, they are expected to attend classes in-person unless they are isolating or quarantining. Additionally, students on F-1 visas who started their graduate program after March 2020 are required by US government guidance to take at least one in-person class per semester to maintain visa compliance. The AIPI Program's offering of in-person classes in Durham ensures that F-1 visa holders in the program meet this requirement.

Furthermore, international students facing delays in visa processing or travel restrictions have been provided with options such as deferring enrollment for up to one year, enrolling in hybrid format courses if they can arrive in the US within 30 days of the first day of class, or taking all online courses for the Fall 2021 semester and joining campus in the Spring 2022 semester.

For International Students 33. I am an international student hoping to come to the United States for Fall 2021, but my home country is backlogged with visa applications due to COVID-19. What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll

When can I register for classes? Fall 2021 course registration for all graduate students will begin on July 7, 2021, in DukeHub. Students may continue making changes to their schedule during the Drop/Add period, which will end on September 3. After Drop/Add ends, students may no longer change their Fall 2021 schedules in DukeHub. 4. How do I register for classes? All students register for classes through DukeHub, the self-service application that provides students with an array of information and direct access to academic, financial, and personal data. Access to DukeHub is gained using your NetID and password. For assistance with registration, please see the help guides linked here. 5. What classes outside of the AIPI curriculum can I count toward my technical electives requirement? Approved AIPI electives are listed on the AIPI website. Additionally, students may take technical electives in other programs and departments across campus with approval from both the course instructor and the AIPI Director. Please note that graduate courses outside of AIPI require an instructor’s permission to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses","For students physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the Fall 2021 semester, attendance at in-person classes at the Duke AIPI Program is expected unless they are isolating or quarantining. It is important to note that any student on an F-1 visa who started their graduate program after March 2020 must take at least one in-person class per semester to remain in visa compliance. As AIPI classes will be offered in-person to students in Durham, F-1 visa holders in the AIPI Program satisfy this requirement."

In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll in. You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your

Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a

Per guidance from the US government, any student on an F-1 visa who began their graduate program after March 2020 must take at least one in-person class per semester to remain in visa compliance. Because AIPI classes will be offered in-person to students who are in Durham, F-1 visaholders in the AIPI Program satisfy this requirement. 17.

Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12. For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there","F-1 visa holders need to take at least one in-person class per semester according to US government guidance to maintain their visa compliance. This requirement ensures that international students on F-1 visas are physically present in the United States and actively engaged in an educational program that includes in-person instruction. This rule is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the shift to online learning has raised concerns about maintaining the integrity of the student visa system and ensuring that students are not taking advantage of the online format to study from abroad without fulfilling the requirements of their visa status."

Fall 2021 classes begin on August 23, 2021. 14. What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 15. How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses? AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class. 16. How will classes be offered in Fall 2021 (e.g., all in-person, online, or a mix of the two)? While Duke will offer classes fully in-person for the Fall 2021 semester, we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students.

For International Students 33. I am an international student hoping to come to the United States for Fall 2021, but my home country is backlogged with visa applications due to COVID-19. What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll","Students in Duke University's AIPI program are not required to stick to one elective track. They have the freedom to select courses that align with their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant to guide students in developing skills in a particular area, but students are not rigidly bound to one track. They can choose electives that best suit their aspirations and may even change their elective track without any formal action required."

Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570).

Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes.

prior machine learning courses in their undergraduate institution will have the option to take an additional technical elective instead of AIPI 520. AIPI 540: Deep Learning Applications- This course focuses on the primary use cases of deep learning to solve challenging problems particularly in the areas of computer vision, natural language processing and recommendation systems. Students will develop an understanding of both the mathematical theory and programmatic implementation of neural networks using Python. The course includes significant hands-on team-based project work and an emphasis on self-discovery. The semester will be split into three core modules: computer vision, NLP, and recommendation systems. Each module will include lectures, assignments, a team project, and a review of recent research in the field. AIPI 561: Operationalizing AI (MLOps)- Deploying AI in production requires consideration of factors such as online model training, scaling, integration with software/hardware products, monitoring/support, security and failure resiliency. This course introduces students via real-world case studies to methods and best practices in deploying AI operationally within products and services, including both technology and support infrastructure considerations. The course will also introduce available technologies for working with Big Data in industries that require specialized infrastructure and tools due to the volume of data. AIPI 501: Industry Seminar Series- Students will attend a weekly seminar series featuring industry leaders discussing the opportunities, challenges and learnings they have gained from applying AI to products and services in their industry.

Working While a Student 27. How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position? Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before. In order to be on Duke’s payroll, all students must have a Social Security Number",Students can access the self-service tool Stellic to track their degree progress by logging into their Stellic account.

How do tuition and fees for auditing courses differ for Campus Program students and Online students?,"22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students?

22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students?

to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).

AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12.

Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward a particular area, and those students who complete a track may list it on their resume. 20. What do I do if I want to change my elective track? If you wish to change your elective track, there is no formal action that you need to take. However, it is a good idea to speak with the program director about your elective course plans, as they can help steer you toward courses that align with your professional aspirations. 21. How can I track my degree progress? Students can track their degree progress using Stellic, a self-service tool that enables students to see which classes they have taken toward their degree and plan for future semesters. Students are strongly encouraged to use Stellic throughout the course of the AIPI Program so that they can stay on track to graduate within the timeframe they choose (two or three semesters).

Working While a Student 27. How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position? Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before.

Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person unless they are isolating or quarantining. Per guidance from the US government, any student on an F-1 visa who began their graduate program after March 2020 must take at least one in-person class per semester to remain in visa compliance. Because AIPI classes will be offered in-person to students who are in Durham, F-1 visaholders in the AIPI Program satisfy this requirement. 17.

Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students? Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs. For more information on the most common financial aid resources that our students utilize, please
to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a
Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12.

22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students? Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs.

1. Health Insurance Fee: The Fall 2021 semester included a health insurance fee of $3,381. This fee may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and related health concerns.

2. Online Offering of Classes: Due to the challenges posed by the pandemic, AIPI classes were offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. This offering accommodated students who may have faced travel and visa challenges, allowing them to participate in classes remotely.

3. Visa Compliance Requirement: The text mentions that students on an F-1 visa who began their graduate program after March 2020 were required to take at least one in-person class per semester to remain in visa compliance. The in-person offering of classes during the Fall 2021 semester facilitated compliance with this requirement for F-1 visa holders.

Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the mode of course delivery, visa compliance regulations, and potentially health-related fees for the Fall 2021 semester at Duke's AIPI program."

When it comes to finding roommates, students can post ads seeking roommates or respond to posts from others who are looking for someone to share their living space. This helps individuals who want to live with others but may not know anyone at the university.

Additionally, for ride-sharing, members of the Duke community can post requests for carpooling or rides to specific destinations, such as for commuting or attending events. This can be a useful resource for individuals looking to share transportation costs or reduce their environmental impact by carpooling.

Overall, DukeList facilitates communication and networking within the Duke University community, allowing individuals to connect with each other for various purposes, including housing, roommates, and ride-sharing."

Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll

What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll","Hybrid classes, also known as blended classes, are a type of course that combines traditional in-person classroom instruction with online learning activities. In the context of the Duke Artificial Intelligence Master of Engineering Program, hybrid classes offer a flexible approach to accommodate students, including those on F-1 visas, during the Fall 2021 semester.

For students on F-1 visas who may face travel and visa challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, enrolling in hybrid classes provides a solution that allows them to start their studies online and transition to in-person classes if and when they are able to arrive in the United States by a specified deadline (in this case, by September 22, 2021). This approach ensures that students can begin their coursework and make progress towards their degrees, even if they are unable to physically attend classes on campus at the start of the semester.

By offering hybrid classes, Duke University aims to provide flexibility and support for international students, including those on F-1 visas, by enabling them to engage in their academic pursuits in a format that can accommodate various circumstances and challenges related to travel and visa restrictions."

For International Students 33. I am an international student hoping to come to the United States for Fall 2021, but my home country is backlogged with visa applications due to COVID-19. What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll
last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12. For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there is no specific documentation that must be provided if you choose to extend the AIPI Program to three semesters. However, the earlier you make the decision the better as it will likely affect your selection of courses in Fall and Spring semesters. 13. When do classes start? Fall 2021 classes begin on August 23, 2021. 14. What are the class meeting patterns for AIPI courses? Each course typically meets once per week for 2 hours and 45 minutes. 15. How much time is required outside of class for AIPI courses? AIPI classes are challenging and require significant work outside of class. Each week, you should expect to spend between 8-10 hours per course working outside of class. 16. How will classes be offered in Fall 2021 (e.g., all in-person, online, or a mix of the two)? While Duke will offer classes fully in-person for the Fall 2021 semester, we understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students. AIPI classes will be offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person

How many courses are students required to take in total in this program?,"Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12. For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there
to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570).

How does the experience vary for participants attending the program online versus on-campus?,"to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).

You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your

Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11.

"In what ways do online students engage with the program, including aspects like live and recorded classes and professional development opportunities?","to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a
Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your classes online for the Fall 2021 semester. 35. Whom do I contact about other visa questions I may have? In the Duke Visa Services Office, Betty Henderson (betty.henderson@duke.edu) is the Visa Services Advisor for Pratt students. You may also contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, for additional visa-related questions. Miscellaneous 36. How do I get my NetID and password? You should receive a separate email from the Office of Information Technology (OIT) with instructions to set up your NetID and email alias. Your NetID is your electronic key to online resources, including your Duke email account, DukeHub, Sakai, MyDuke, Box cloud storage, and more. Please set up your NetID as soon as possible. 37. When will I get access to my Duke email? Once you set up your NetID (see above), you will be able to access your email. This site provides information about how to access your Duke email account. Once you have access to your Duke email, please begin checking and using this address. Your Duke email address will become the primary source for all your communications from Duke. 38. What can I do this summer to prepare for AIPI? While some of our students
track? No, there is not currently a formal process to designate your elective track. We do not require students to rigidly adhere to one elective track. Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward a particular area, and those students who complete a track may list it on their resume. 20. What do I do if I want to change my elective track? If you wish to change your elective track, there is no formal action that you need to take. However, it is a good idea to speak with the program director about your elective course plans, as they can help steer you toward courses that align with your professional aspirations. 21. How can I track my degree progress? Students can track their degree progress using Stellic, a self-service tool that enables students to see which classes they have taken toward their degree and plan for future semesters. Students are strongly encouraged to use Stellic throughout the course of the AIPI Program so that they can stay on track to graduate within the timeframe they choose (two or three semesters). Tuition and Billing 22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there
able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll in. You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your
Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11. What is the last day that I can register for Fall 2021 classes? Students may make changes to their schedule up to the end of the Drop/Add period, which ends on September 3, 2021. 12.

While some of our students come directly from undergraduate programs which focus heavily on programming and/or math, many students come from other branches of engineering, science or medicine, or join our program after a few years of industry experience. Spending some time before the Fall semester start brushing up on your programming (Python preferable) and math skills will help make the learning curve a bit easier once classes start. If you are not comfortable with Python programming and math (calculus, probability and statistics, basic linear algebra), we highly recommend pursuing some independent study before the Bootcamp begins in late July. To assist you we have compiled some recommended resources on the AIPI student site.

While some of our students come directly from undergraduate programs which focus heavily on programming and/or math, many students come from other branches of engineering, science or medicine, or join our program after a few years of industry experience. Spending some time before the Fall semester start brushing up on your programming (Python preferable) and math skills will help make the learning curve a bit easier once classes start. If you are not comfortable with Python programming and math (calculus, probability and statistics, basic linear algebra), we highly recommend pursuing some independent study before the Bootcamp begins in late July.

What should I do? You have several options to choose from in this situation: (a) defer your enrollment for up to one year; (b) enroll in courses with a hybrid format if you believe you can arrive in the United States within 30 days of the first day of class; or (c) enroll in all online courses, remain in your home country for the Fall 2021 semester, and join us on campus in Spring 2022. Duke will be offering Fall 2021 courses in a hybrid format, so that students who are unable to travel to the United States are still able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees.

Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a flat-rate per-semester basis. 9. What is the limit on credits I can take each semester? AIPI students may take up to 15.0 credits per semester. Full-time residential students on the pay-by-semester basis may take a fifth credit for free each semester (although we generally suggest a maximum of 4 courses as the workload can be intense). Students who attempt to enroll in more than 15.0 credits per semester will not be able to register. 10. What is Drop/Add? What happens during the Drop/Add period? The Drop/Add period occurs after the initial Registration window and continues until the end of the second week of classes. During the Drop/Add period, students may make changes to their schedules through DukeHub. At the end of the Drop/Add period (September 3, 2021), students’ schedules may no longer be changed in DukeHub and can only be changed with permission from their dean. 11.

For Campus students, is there a formal process for selecting between the 12-month and 16-month plan? No, there","Students who default on their payments for tuition and fees at Duke University may face several consequences:

1. **Transcript and Diploma Holds**: If a student is in default, they will not be allowed to receive a transcript of academic records or a diploma at graduation. This can impact their ability to transfer credits, apply for jobs, or pursue further education.

2. **Late Payment Charges**: There may be late payment charges imposed on students who fail to pay their invoices in full by the due date. These charges can add to the overall amount owed by the student.

22. How much does it cost to audit a course? For AIPI students who pay tuition on a pay-by-semester basis (as is the case for all full-time residential AIPI students), there is no charge for auditing a course. For AIPI Online students who pay tuition on a pay-by-credit basis, there is a charge of $535 per audited course. 23. How are tuition and fees assessed for AIPI students? Full-time students in the AIPI Campus Program are automatically set up on a pay-per-semester billing system, meaning they will be charged the equivalent of four separate courses. Students enrolling as AIPI Online and Certificate students will automatically be set up for payments on a per-credit basis. 24. Can I change my tuition billing basis from per-semester to per-credit? Yes, your tuition can be changed from pay-by-semester to pay-by-credit if you are switching to part-time status. (Please note that F-1 visaholders must be enrolled full-time for at least 9.0 credits per semester). If you intend to take less than the typical load (four courses for full-time), please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, to make this change. The last day for making changes to a student’s billing structure is the last day of Drop/Add in that semester. 25. Is financial aid available to AIPI students? Because the AIPI degree is a professional degree rather than a research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs. For more information on the most common financial aid resources that our students utilize, please

2. Food and Dining: While the estimated cost of board typically includes dining expenses on campus, students may have additional food costs if they prefer to eat out, cook at home, or have dietary preferences that require special accommodations.

3. Personal Expenses: Personal expenses such as clothing, toiletries, entertainment, and other miscellaneous items are not typically included in the estimated total cost of attendance and should be budgeted for separately.

4. Transportation: While local transportation costs are included in the estimated expenses, students may have additional transportation expenses for travel, commuting, or other personal needs.

5. Health and Wellness: While health fees and insurance are included in the estimated costs, students may still have additional healthcare expenses, gym memberships, wellness activities, or other health-related costs.

6. Technology and Supplies: Additional expenses related to technology, software, equipment, and supplies beyond what is covered in the estimated costs may be incurred depending on the student's needs and preferences.

7. Professional Development: Students may incur costs related to attending conferences, workshops, networking events, or other professional development opportunities to enhance their skills and career prospects.

It's essential for students to carefully consider these potential additional living expenses and budget accordingly to ensure they can cover all costs associated with their time in the program."

Do I still have to pay fees? If you will not be on campus in the Fall 2021 semester due to COVID-19, please contact Kelsey Liddle (kelsey.liddle@duke.edu), the Pratt Student Records Coordinator, regarding student fees. Working While a Student 27. How do I get a Teaching Assistant (TA) position? Teaching assistantships are a common way that AIPI students can work on campus, earn money, and give of their time to the AIPI community. Most often, course instructors approach students who have done well in their course and ask them to TA in a subsequent semester. Other times, students will voice their interest to the instructor to initiate the conversation about a TA position. Toward the beginning of each semester, there are usually a few TA positions to be filled, and an announcement about open positions will be emailed out to students. TA positions are not often available for incoming students, as these positions are typically filled by continuing students who have taken the course before.

3. **Model Validation**:
   - **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to assess the model's generalization capabilities and reduce overfitting.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate the model's performance.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
   - **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models using validation metrics to select the best-performing model.

- Image classification refers to the task of assigning a label or category to an entire image based on its content. In this task, the model is trained to recognize and categorize images into predefined classes. For example, given an image of a cat, the model should output the label ""cat.""

- Object detection, on the other hand, is the task of identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image. It not only classifies the objects present in the image but also provides information about their locations by drawing bounding boxes around them. Object detection models are capable of detecting multiple objects of different classes within a single image.

Having a clear design of the overall system as a starting point helps to provide a solid basis for developers to follow and it allows higher productivity and software quality. Students immerse themselves into architecture understanding from multiple perspectives through various UML diagrams including different software architectures frameworks, when and how they are used, their advantages and disadvantages. Software architecture is tied to many practical business concerns. These include the skills and organization of the software engineering team, the needs of the business, the development cycle, and the intent of the software

1. **Data Analysis and Threat Detection**: Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from various sources such as logs, network traffic, and user behavior to detect patterns indicative of cyber threats. By identifying anomalous activities or potential security breaches, AI-powered systems can help in early threat detection.

2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Machine learning models can be trained to understand normal behavior patterns of users and systems within an organization. Any deviation from these patterns can trigger alerts for potential security incidents, enabling proactive response to threats.

3. **Automated Incident Response**: AI algorithms can automate the process of responding to security incidents by quickly analyzing and prioritizing alerts based on their severity. This can help in reducing response times and mitigating potential damage caused by cyberattacks.

4. **Vulnerability Management**: Machine learning can assist in identifying vulnerabilities in software and systems by analyzing code for potential weaknesses. This proactive approach can help in patching vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious actors.

5. **Deep Learning for Advanced Threat Detection**: Deep learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, can be used to detect complex threats like zero-day exploits or advanced persistent threats. These models can continuously learn from new data to improve their detection capabilities over time.

6. **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Courses like ""ML in Adversarial Settings"" may focus on understanding and defending against attacks on machine learning systems themselves. By studying potential vulnerabilities in AI models, cybersecurity professionals can enhance the robustness of their defense mechanisms.

7. **Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Security**: Deep reinforcement learning can be applied to security scenarios to create adaptive defense mechanisms that can learn and evolve in response to changing threat landscapes. This approach enables systems to autonomously adapt their security measures based on real-time feedback.

In summary, by integrating machine learning and AI techniques into cybersecurity tools and practices, organizations can enhance their ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats effectively."

Here's how these factors relate to software architecture:

1. **Team Skills**:
   - The skills and organization of the software engineering team directly impact the design decisions made during software architecture development. A team with expertise in a particular technology stack or framework may influence the choice of architectural patterns that align with their skill set.
   - Software architecture needs to consider the team's capabilities and limitations to ensure that the chosen architectural style is implementable by the team members.
   - Team skills also influence the communication and collaboration within the team, which is essential for designing and implementing a coherent and effective software architecture.

2. **Software Intent**:
   - The intent or purpose of the software, including its functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and business goals, greatly influences the software architecture decisions. For example, software intended for high scalability may require a distributed architecture, while software focused on data processing may benefit from a layered architecture.
   - The software intent guides the selection of architectural patterns that best align with the desired features and performance characteristics of the software.
   - Understanding the business needs and goals helps in defining the quality attributes that the software architecture should prioritize, such as performance, security, maintainability, or scalability.

In summary, team skills and software intent are integral factors that drive software architecture decisions. A well-designed software architecture not only considers technical aspects but also aligns with the skills of the development team and the intended purpose of the software to meet business objectives effectively."

1. Subscription Model: Customers pay a recurring fee at regular intervals (monthly, annually) to access the software or services. This model provides a steady stream of revenue and encourages customer retention.

2. Freemium Model: The basic version of the software is offered for free, while premium features or functionalities are available for a fee. This model allows for widespread adoption and upselling to paying customers.

3. Perpetual License Model: Customers make a one-time payment to purchase a license to use the software indefinitely. This model is less common in the age of subscription-based services but is still used for certain types of software.

4. Usage-Based Model: Customers are charged based on their usage of the software, such as the number of active users, transactions processed, or data storage used. This model can be flexible for customers but requires careful monitoring of usage metrics.

5. Advertising Model: Software is offered for free, with revenue generated through advertising placements within the software or through partnerships with advertisers. This model is commonly used for mobile apps and websites.

6. Enterprise Model: Software is tailored for large organizations or businesses, with pricing based on the number of users or the size of the organization. This model often includes additional features for enterprise-level support and security.

These are just a few examples of the monetization models that software companies can use to generate revenue from their products or services. The choice of model often depends on factors such as the target market, competitive landscape, and the value proposition of the software."

How are participants expected to manage their time effectively while working full-time and completing the certificate program?,"able to participate in classes and make progress toward their degrees. In the AIPI Program, if you anticipate that you will be able to make it to Durham in time to participate in-person (i.e., by September 22), you should register for the hybrid sections of the courses that you enroll in. You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person. If you are unable to reach the United States by September 22, you can continue taking your
to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510). Online students pay tuition on a per-credit basis rather than a

Here are some strategies that can help participants successfully navigate this balance:

1. Time Management Skills: Developing strong time management skills is crucial for juggling work and academic commitments. Participants should create a schedule that allocates specific time slots for work, studying, assignments, and any other personal responsibilities.

2. Prioritization: Participants should prioritize tasks based on deadlines and importance. By identifying key tasks and focusing on them first, participants can ensure that they are making progress on their academic requirements while fulfilling their work responsibilities.

3. Setting Realistic Goals: It is important for participants to set realistic and achievable goals for both their work and academic endeavors. Breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps can help participants stay on track and make steady progress.

4. Communication with Employers: Participants should communicate with their employers about their academic commitments and work schedule. Clear communication can help manage expectations and potentially negotiate flexible work arrangements to accommodate academic requirements.

5. Utilizing Support Systems: Participants can leverage support systems such as family, friends, colleagues, or academic advisors to help them stay motivated and on track. Seeking guidance and assistance when needed can alleviate stress and improve overall productivity.

6. Self-Care: It is essential for participants to prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Adequate rest, exercise, and relaxation can help participants stay focused, energized, and better equipped to manage their dual responsibilities.

By implementing these strategies and maintaining a proactive approach to time management, participants can effectively balance their full-time work commitments with the demands of the certificate program at Duke University."

While academic qualifications such as having an undergraduate degree in science or engineering, programming experience, and coursework in calculus are important requirements for admission, work experience is also highly valued in the admissions process. Roughly half of the students in the program join directly after their undergraduate studies, while the other half enter after gaining work experience. 

Having work experience can be beneficial as it brings real-world knowledge and expertise to the program, complementing the technical skills learned in the classroom. Many students enter the program with strong prior experience in programming or software development, while others come with more domain-specific expertise but less programming experience. The program is designed to accommodate both types of participants, recognizing the value of practical experience alongside academic qualifications.

Overall, while academic qualifications are important for admission to the Duke AI MEng program, work experience is also a significant factor and can enhance an applicant's profile by demonstrating practical skills, industry knowledge, and a strong foundation for success in the field of artificial intelligence."

that the COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and visa challenges for many of our international students. AIPI classes will be offered both in-person and online for the Fall 2021 semester. Students who will be physically located in Durham, NC, USA, for the semester are expected to come to class in-person unless they are isolating or quarantining. Per guidance from the US government, any student on an F-1 visa who began their graduate program after March 2020 must take at least one in-person class per semester to remain in visa compliance. Because AIPI classes will be offered in-person to students who are in Durham, F-1 visaholders in the AIPI Program satisfy this requirement. 17. Where can I find other important dates related to academics? The 2021-2022 Duke Academic Calendar can be found here. We strongly recommend students bookmark this page in their browser for easy reference. 18. Where do I find other important information about the AIPI Program? The AIPI student website contains a wealth of information about the AIPI program and life at Duke. University policies surrounding academics may also be found on the Office of the University Registrar website. 19. Is there a formal process for designating my elective track? No, there is not currently a formal process to designate your elective track. We do not require students to rigidly adhere to one elective track. Students may choose electives that fit their professional goals. The elective tracks are meant as guides for students to align and develop skills toward
to enroll, and it is ultimately at the instructor’s discretion to determine whether or not AIPI students will be allowed into a particular class. 6. Can I audit classes? Yes, AIPI students may audit courses on a space-available basis with consent of the instructor and the AIPI Director. Audited courses appear on your transcript and you will receive a grade of AD (indicating successful completion) that will not count toward your GPA. Audited courses do not count toward the fulfillment of AIPI degree requirements. 7. How many classes can I audit per semester? AIPI students may audit up to two courses per semester. 8. How many classes should I register for? In order for international students to remain in compliance with their F-1 visas, they must be registered as a full-time student. For visa purposes, full-time enrollment is considered 9.0 credits per semester (equivalent to three 3.0-credit courses). However, a typical full-time load for AIPI Campus students is 12.0 credits per semester (four 3.0-credit courses). Therefore, full-time residential graduate students pay tuition on a flat-rate, per-semester billing basis and are charged the equivalent of 12.0 credits per semester. Most full-time students enroll in at least 12.0 credits per semester. AIPI Campus students take a fixed set of 4 courses in Fall semester (AIPI 510,520,530 and MENG 570). AIPI Online students typically take 2 courses per semester (Fall: AIPI 510,520) and AIPI Certificate students take 1 course/semester (Fall: AIPI 510).

You may also enroll in the fully-online section of a course if you know that you will be unable to travel to the United States for the Fall 2021 semester. 34. I hope to arrive in the United States for Fall 2021 classes, but it might be after drop/add ends. What should I do? Students on F-1 visas have until 30 days after the first day of class to arrive in the United States. For Fall 2021, classes begin on August 23, so students must arrive in the United States by September 22. Drop/Add ends on September 3, after which students may not make changes to their Fall 2021 course schedules. Therefore, we recommend that if you anticipate arriving in the United States between September 3 and September 22, you enroll in Fall classes that are being offered according to the Hybrid (i.e., both in-person and online accessible) model. Begin taking these classes online at the beginning of the semester, and if you are able to reach the United States by September 22, you will be able to continue your studies in-person.

Advantages of Submitting Early:
1. Early Consideration: Submitting your application early increases the likelihood of having your application reviewed earlier in the process, potentially leading to an earlier decision.
2. More Time for Preparation: By submitting early, you give yourself more time to gather all required materials, such as transcripts, recommendations, and test scores, ensuring a thorough and well-prepared application.
3. Early Notification: If you are accepted early, you will have more time to plan for enrollment, secure funding, and make any necessary arrangements.

Disadvantages of Submitting Early:
1. Limited Opportunity for Improvement: If you submit your application early and later find ways to strengthen it, such as improving test scores or acquiring additional relevant experiences, you may have missed the opportunity to include these updates in your application.
2. Longer Wait for Decision: While submitting early can lead to an early decision, in some cases, it may also mean a longer wait for the final decision if the program does not review applications on a rolling basis.

Advantages of Submitting Closer to the Deadline:
1. More Time for Preparation and Enhancement: By waiting closer to the deadline, you have more time to work on enhancing your application, such as retaking tests for better scores or gaining additional experiences to include.
2. Potential for Updated Information: Waiting closer to the deadline allows you to include any recent achievements or updates that could strengthen your application.

Disadvantages of Submitting Closer to the Deadline:
1. Increased Competition: Submitting closer to the deadline means that your application will be in direct competition with a larger pool of applicants who may have submitted earlier.
2. Risk of Technical Issues: Waiting until the deadline to submit your application increases the risk of encountering technical issues that could potentially delay or disrupt the submission process.

In conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages to both submitting early and closer to the deadline, it is generally advisable to submit your application early to maximize your chances of early consideration, have more time for preparation and potentially receive an early decision. However, ensure that your application is thorough and well-prepared regardless of when you submit it."
